# Bias Reduction in Dating Apps Project Images

This folder contains images for the Bias Reduction project page. Below are descriptions of each image file and what should replace the placeholder:

## hero-interface-comparison.jpg
**Description:** Main hero image showing a comparison between traditional swipe interface and redesigned interface
**Size:** 1200x630px (16:9 ratio)
**Content:** A side-by-side comparison showing the traditional photo-first interface next to your redesigned profile-first interface. Use a clean, modern design that emphasizes the difference in information presentation order.

## traditional-swipe-interface.jpg
**Description:** Mockup of standard swipe interface with photo-first presentation
**Size:** 375x667px (standard mobile screen)
**Content:** A realistic mockup of a dating app with the traditional design showing a profile photo prominently with minimal text information visible initially. Should resemble familiar swipe interfaces but use fictional profile information.

## redesigned-info-first-interface.jpg
**Description:** Mockup of redesigned interface showing profile details before photo
**Size:** 375x667px (standard mobile screen)
**Content:** A mockup of your redesigned interface that shows profile information, interests, and compatibility metrics first, with the photo accessible but not as the initial focal point. Use the same fictional profile as in the traditional interface for clear comparison.

## bias-reduction-results.jpg
**Description:** Bar chart comparing percentage of racially biased choices across interface types
**Size:** 800x500px
**Content:** A data visualization showing how racial bias in selection patterns differed between the traditional swipe interface and your redesigned interface. Include confidence intervals and statistical significance markers.

## demographic-analysis.jpg
**Description:** Visualization of experimental results across demographic groups
**Size:** 800x500px
**Content:** A chart or graph showing how different demographic groups responded to the interface changes, particularly highlighting whether the bias reduction effect was consistent across user segments.
